# Rails Final Project (Social Network) - The Odin Project | Full-Stack Ruby on Rails Course

Repo for the Rails Final Project of the Full-Stack Ruby on Rails Program, from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

The objective was to build and deploy a web app that had the core features of a social network like Facebook. The full project description and requirements can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-rails-final-project).

Features implemented:
- Sign up and sign in flows (including OAuth)
- Creating, editing and viewing profiles (profile pages)
- Sending, accepting and rejecting friend requests
- Posting texts
- Commenting on posts
- Liking posts
- Liking comments
- Real time notifications with WebSockets

I've taken it out of production after Heroku discontinued its free tier of dynos.
